          How hard is it to change GitHub username to a short word?
Last week I decided to change mine from a 14 letter word to some 4-6 letter word. Don&amp;rsquo;t ask me why. I was fed up typing long words!
The new username should ideally be &amp;mdash;
Comfortable in speaking Easily pronounceable Faster to type Visually good looking The hunt # My quest began manually with initial candidates as ashr, friday, ranj, aran, etc.

          There is still a place for innovation.
Last month I had a conversation with my friends about how most of the world has already been invented. And we aren&amp;rsquo;t going to see a life changing innovation in our lifetime.
Look at how
Uber changed transportation GitHub changed collaboration Amazon changed shopping Tesla changed cars Google changed mobile phones Apple changed computers WhatsApp changed connectivity Tinder changed the lovesphere In the past five years, things has been pretty constant.

          Choose any two — Maintainable, Configurable, Speed.
When creating a new software, you could only have two out of the following:
Maintainable Configurable Speed If you choose to focus on maintainability and configurability, it&amp;rsquo;ll take a long time to develop and performance might be impacted.
If you choose to focus on maintainability and speed (of development and performance), you might not have a configurable system (i.e. with many features and options).

          A long long time ago, everybody lived happily.
Bright lights made up everything. Love and affection held it all together in one small beautiful place. There was no room for ego, malice or envy. It had all the ingredients to make up an ideal world filled with harmony and peace and a future that was promised to have unlimited energy. They were going to call it home.
Then the evil empire attacked.

          When depression knocks the door.
While trawling one of my favourite repos - exa, I stumbled upon something I never would have expected. A heartful message from its author when he wasn&amp;rsquo;t at his best.
This is as real as it gets. Unfortunately nobody knows about it, because we don&amp;rsquo;t talk about it.
exa v0.4.1 (basically a pre-release v0.5.0) — Mar 29, 2017
This is a snapshot of exa&amp;rsquo;s current code, which has been cleaned up a bit and at the very least been run through untry (which managed to pick apart all try!
