      <p>When depression knocks the door.</p>
<p>While trawling one of my favourite repos -
<a href="https://github.com/ogham/exa"><strong>exa</strong></a>, I stumbled upon something I
never would have expected. A heartful message from its author when he
wasn&rsquo;t at his best.</p>
<p>This is as real as it gets. Unfortunately nobody knows about it, because
we don&rsquo;t talk about it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ogham/exa/releases/tag/v0.4.1"><strong>exa v0.4.1 (basically a pre-release
v0.5.0)</strong></a> <strong>— Mar
29, 2017</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>This is a snapshot of exa&rsquo;s current code, which has been cleaned up a
bit and at the very least been run through untry (which managed to
pick apart all try!s but one). It&rsquo;s being released to work around a
bug in macOS Sierra.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Usually when I do a release I go through the commit history, pick out
anything that looks like it could be a bullet point in the release
notes, look at the contributors and see who&rsquo;s there, then edit the
website and upload — there are more features in here than just the
openssl upgrade, and the work done so far is really deserving of a
&ldquo;proper&rdquo; release, rather than just a beta.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>But I don&rsquo;t even want to learn how little work I&rsquo;ve done on it in the
past twelve months.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I think I need to be honest with everyone here. My interest in exa is
still there, and the list of features I&rsquo;d still like to add is as long
as it&rsquo;s ever been, but my motivation is completely shot. Compared to
even a year ago it&rsquo;s plummeted. Every day I go to work, bang out code
on whatever it is I&rsquo;m doing, leave, arrive home, then do my best to
not do anything, on the computer or off it. My life&rsquo;s going alright, I
can still do things, I&rsquo;m able to do things, but I just&hellip; don&rsquo;t, and I
wish I could give you a better reason than that. GitHub notifications
were something I&rsquo;d deal with later that day, then next week, then
whenever I&rsquo;d get around to it, and then routed into a folder in my
inbox that I never actually checked, and then every day I&rsquo;d see that
number and hope it didn&rsquo;t increase, and then I noticed that whenever
it did increase I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to concentrate on anything for
another hour, so I just hid it, which hurt at first but at least gave
me some time back. I&rsquo;d still commit from time to time, but not mention
any of this because I didn&rsquo;t want to call attention to it, as though
in time everyone would just forget. Whenever I saw a reply to the
Sierra bug thread, I&rsquo;d log in, read it, start to worry that if I
replied now then I&rsquo;d be admitting to everyone that I was still around
and hadn&rsquo;t died or something and was instead just ignoring their
comments, and then what would people think of me? I even got as far as
navigating to &ldquo;Delete this repository&rdquo; before I had to push the
computer away.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>That&rsquo;s one push that went correctly. It&rsquo;s obvious to say, but it&rsquo;s
stupid to delete code that people are using, just because you didn&rsquo;t
want to deal with the fact that you made a mistake.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I&rsquo;m going to try something new:</em> <em><strong>switching exa to a routine 6-week
release schedule</strong></em>. <em>The Rust has a release train that works over the
same duration using multiple versions. I think exa (a hundredth its
size) can do without that part, but the rest of it is good advice.
Having an actual date for each one means I don&rsquo;t get a choice in
releasing anything or not, which is an incredible motivator for
actually doing it! I still have to put 0.5.0 out properly, but with
luck, the second release (0.6.0, which would come out halfway through
May) would be a lot less daunting than the first, the third less than
the second, and it would plateau from there.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The root advice here is &ldquo;if you&rsquo;re having difficulty doing something,
then do it more often, because it gets easier&rdquo;. I found actually
releasing my software hard. I want it to be easier.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I hope you all find this acceptable, and I apologise again for the
massive commit lacuna.</em></p>
